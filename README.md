Currently available are only MLP's with basic functionalities.

### Future plans include:
- CNN
- RNN
- more activation functions
- more loss functions
- optimizers other than gradient descent
- more metrics
- and more useful functionalities

### ToDo for now list:
- dropout layer
- add javadocs to all classes and methods
- description of equations used in project
